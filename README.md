# eztxt  
A small prototype text editor with syntax highlighting for mips assembly that will eventually be rolled into mips2c to create a mips ide and emulator.    
Written in C using ncurses. Based mostly on `GNU nano`.  
  
This is still very much a work in progress, I wouldn't recommend using it on any data you like.  
  
To build: `make`  
To open a file for editing: `./eztxt filename.ext`  
compiled and tested with: `gcc v10.2.0` and `GNU make 4.1` on `ubuntu 16.04`. Tested with `Byobu terminal`, `XTerm`, and `GNOME terminal`.
